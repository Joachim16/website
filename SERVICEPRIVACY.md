# IPDB Service - Privacy Policy


## Introduction

### Purpose
This Privacy Policy governs your use of the IPDB Sites and IPDB Service. The Privacy Policy describes the collection, storage, and use of personal information in your use of the IPDB Service. 

### The IPDB Service is a Public Blockchain Database
The IPDB Service is a public blockchain database. This has two important privacy implications: 
1) the **information recorded on it is public**, and 
2) the **information recorded on it cannot be deleted**, not even by the IPDB Foundation or the Caretakers.

### Values
These values inform everything we do with personal information.

#### Privacy is a Human Right
We believe that privacy is a human right and is necessary for human flourishing. 

#### Your Information is Yours
Your personal information belongs to you. We make no claim to it, except to use it as you allow us.

#### Minimize Collection
We collect and use as little information as possible while still providing the IPDB Service.

#### Minimize Retention
We only keep information for as long as is absolutely necessary for us to operate the IPDB Services or to comply with the law.

#### Clarity
We want this Privacy Policy to be easy to read and understand. If you have questions about what something means or suggestions for how to make something more clear, email us: privacy@ipdbfoundation.org.

### No Key Recovery
There is no way for us to help you recover or change your Key if you lose it. Guard it carefully! 

*We cannot tell you how to keep your key safe, but *[LINK TO SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS].

### Definitions
The Privacy Policy is meant to be read together with the IPDB Service Terms, so capitalized terms mean the same as they do in the IPDB Service Terms.

### Sharing Information
Personal information will not be given to third parties except as set out below. Personal Information will never be given to advertisers.

## Using the IPDB Service

### Signing Up
You do not need to sign up to use the IPDB Service. You just need to create a Key to conduct Transactions.

### Making Transactions
Every Transaction you conduct on the IPDB Service is permanently associated with your Key on the IPDB Service. 

### History of Transactions
The IPDB Service allows you to view a full history of any object on the IPDB Service and the Keys involved in any Transactions, right back to the Key that originally registered it. 

This history is permanent and can never be changed or deleted, not even by the IPDB Foundation.

### Counting Transactions
The IPDB Foundation keeps track of the number of Transactions a given key is allowed to make. 

### Purchasing Transactions
You may need to sign up to purchase additional Transactions if you use more than your free quota. You can purchase additional Transactions from the IPDB Foundation or from another entity that sells transactions (“Transaction Agent”). 

If you purchase Transactions from another Transaction Agent, you will be subject to its privacy policy. 

If you sign up to purchase Transactions from the IPDB Foundation, your purchase will be governed by the IPDB Foundation Store Privacy Policy.

## Transactions on the IPDB Service
*Note: The information in this section is a non-technical explanation of how and where information is stored in the IPDB Service. A thorough explanation of the workings of BigchainDB, the software behind the IPDB Service, is available in the [BigchainDB whitepaper](https://www.bigchaindb.com/whitepaper/)*.

### Caretaker Nodes
Each of the Caretakers in the IPDB Foundation operates a server (“Caretaker Node”) that checks each Transaction to see if it is valid. If a majority of the Caretaker Nodes agree the Transaction is valid, the Transaction is written to the IPDB Service. 

There are two kinds of Caretaker Nodes:
- Hardware Nodes are operated by Caretakers in the Caretaker’s own facilities. Hardware Nodes are subject to this Privacy Policy.
- Cloud Nodes are operated on cloud service providers, including services from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Cloud Nodes are subject to the privacy policies of the companies hosting them as well as to this Privacy Policy.

### Data Storage
Caretaker Nodes also store the Transactions and all information associated with them.

The IPFS Service stores the Transactions sent by Users on at least [NUMBER] of Caretaker Nodes, for a replication factor of [X]. These Caretaker Nodes are [RANDOMLY SELECTED? HOW CHOSEN?].

Some of the Caretaker Nodes may be located outside of your jurisdiction. There are Caretaker Nodes in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. 

By using the IPDB Service, you consent to the IPDB Foundation and Caretakers storing the information you provide in your Transactions in places where Caretaker Nodes are located. You understand that the laws of those jurisdictions may apply to the information stored in those jursidiction.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

### Requests for Information

We respond to requests for information only if supported by valid legal process,such as a warrant or court order. If we receive a request for information, we will notify the subject of the request as soon as possible, if we have the ability to do so.

#### Transparency Report
If and when we receive a governmental request for information, we will begin producing a quarterly report providing as much information as possible on the number and nature of those requests.

#### Canary
We have never received a request for information from a governmental body. If that changes, we will remove this section.

### Requests for Takedowns
The nature of the IPDB Service means it is not possible to delete content that has been uploaded to it.
