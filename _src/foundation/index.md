title: Foundation &amp; governance
subtitle: Decentralized without dysfunction.
---

Building an organization that is both decentralized and stable enough to govern itself is not easy. Weâ€™ve worked hard to learn from those who came before us, from the DNS to The DAO.

IPDB is governed by IPDB Foundation consisting of caretakers and the board of directors these caretakers elect.

# IPDB Caretakers

IPDB relies on caretakers to run the nodes that store and validate transactions sent to the network. The caretakers are members of the IPDB Foundation.

# Board members

Board of directors does this and that. Changes under which conditions. Members are elected by the IPDB caretakers.

# Vision & Research

The early web gave us a utopian vision of a decentralized world. Corporate giants and governments would be replaced. We would live in a society where we deal directly with one another, free of censorship or coercion.

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of the Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
- John Perry Barlow, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, 1996

The internet has displaced many of the old powers, but new powers dominate the web as we know it. Freedom of expression is often limited. The ironic result of this centralized control is a fragmented internet where the information you have access to is determined by your location and providers, things you have no control over.

We promote science and research through the development of the IPDB decentralized database platform, on the governance of decentralized systems, and the applications of blockchain technology.

We will make our work available in many ways: presentations at conferences and workshops, published research results and technical papers, open sourced code, and more. We will make everything available online, so everyone can benefit from our research.

Watch the presentation from the Blue Yard Decentralized & Encrypted event that took place1 June 2016 in Berlin.
